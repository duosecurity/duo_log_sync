## About
`duologsync` (DLS) is a utility written by Duo Security that supports fetching logs from Duo endpoints and ingesting them to different SIEMs.

---
## Prerequisite

`duologsync` requires credentials for an Admin API application with the "Grant read log" API permission. Create this application before installation and configuration.

To create the Admin API application:

1. Log into the Duo Admin Panel as an administrator with the "Owner" role and navigate to **Applications**.
2. Click **Protect an Application** and locate the entry for **Admin API** in the applications list.
3. Click **Protect** to the far-right to configure the application and get your integration key, secret key, and API hostname. You'll need this information to update the `config.yml` file later.
4. Scroll down to the "Permissions" section of the page and deselect all permission options other than **Grant read log**.
5. Optionally specify which IP addresses or ranges are allowed to use this Admin API application in **Networks for API Access**. If you do not specify any IP addresses or ranges, this Admin API application may be accessed from any network.
6. Click **Save**.

MSP customers gathering logs from linked accounts should create an **Accounts API** Duo application and use that application's information in the `config.yml` file.

## Installation

- Make sure you are running Python 3+ with `python --version`.
- Clone this GitHub repository and navigate to the `duo_log_sync` folder.
- Ensure you have "setuptools" by running `pip3 install setuptools`.
- Install required packages by running `pip/pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
- Install `duologsync` by running `python/python3 setup.py install`. 
- Refer to the `Configuration` section below. You will need to create a `config.yml` file and fill out credentials for the adminapi in the duoclient section as well as other parameters if necessary.
- Run the application using `duologsync <complete/path/to/config.yml>`.
- If a new version of DLS is downloaded from GitHub, run the setup command again to reinstall `duologsync` for changes to take effect.

### Compatibility

- Duologsync is compatible with Python versions `3.6`, `3.7`, and `3.8`.
- Duologsync is officially supported on Linux, MacOS, and Windows systems.

### Windows
- On Windows operating systems, `duologsync` is installed in the `\scripts\` folder under the Python installation in most cases.
---

## Logging
- A logging filepath can be specified in `config.yml`. By default, logs will be stored under the `/tmp` folder with name `duologsync.log`.
- These logs are only application/system logs, and not the actual logs retrieved from Duo endpoints.

---

## Features

- Current version supports fetching logs from auth, telephony, admin, and trust monitor endpoints and sending over TCP, TCP Encrypted over SSL, and UDP to consuming systems.
- Ability to recover data by reading from last known offset through checkpointing files.
- Enabling only certain endpoints through config file.
- Choosing how logs are formatted (JSON, CEF).
- Support for Linux, MacOS, Windows.
- Support for pulling logs using Accounts API (only for MSP accounts).

### Work in progress

- Adding more log endpoints.
- Adding better skey security.
- Adding CEF and MSP support for the Trust Monitor endpoint.

---

## System Requirements

- Duo Log Sync must be run a system set to the UTC/GMT Timezone

## Configuration

- See [`template_config.yml`](./template_config.yml) for an example and for extensive, in-depth config explanation.

### Upgrading Your Config File
- From time to time new features and fields will be added to the config file. Updating of the config file is mandatory when config changes are made. To make this easier, Duo has created a script called [`upgrade_config.py`](./upgrade_config.py) which will automatically update your old config for you.
- To use the `upgrade_config.py` script, simply run the following command: `python3 upgrade_config.py <old_config> <new_config>` where `<old_config>` is the filepath or your old configuration file, and `<new_config>` is where you would like the new configuration file to be saved.
- The `upgrade_config.py` script will not delete your old config file, it will be preserved.
- This script is a new feature and has to extrapolate some information, some unexpected issues may occur. For most old configs the script will work just fine. You can check if the new config file works by running it with DLS.
- The `is_msp` field under accounts section is required only when using DLS with the Accounts API. For this reason, the upgrade script won't create that field in new config by default.

---

## Additional Considerations

### MSP customers

- Calling Admin API handlers with Accounts API is mutually exclusive with cross-deployment sub-accounts. Many customers with sub-accounts (especially MSPs) must use cross-deployment sub-accounts and therefore can't use the Accounts API. 

### Trust Monitor Support
- Currently, the Trust Monitor endpoint only supports logging in JSON format, and does not support MSPs. Calling this endpoint (in combination with any other endpoints) using CEF format or MSPs will not allow the program to execute.
