# Fields for changing the functionality of DuoLogSync (DLS)
# The fields for dls_settings, including dls_setting itself are not required.
# Default values may be given for all the fields if you choose not to include
# them.
#dls_settings:
    
  # File where DLS program messages / logs should be saved

  # How Duo logs should be formatted before being sent to a server
  # OPTIONS: CEF, JSON
  #log_format: 'JSON'

  # Setting related to API calls for Duo logs
  #api:

    # Days in the past from which record retrieval should begin.
    # MINIMUM: 0

    #offset: 180

    # Seconds to wait between API calls (for fetching Duo logs)
    # MINIMUM: 120

  # Settings related to saving API call offset information into files for use
  # when DLS crashes so that DLS can pickup where it left off. Useful for
  # reducing the chance of consuming duplicate logs when a crash occurs.
  #checkpointing:

    # Whether checkpoint files should be created to save offset information
    # about API calls. If true, the value set for directory (or the default of
    # '/tmp') is where DLS will look for checkpoint files to recover offset
    # information from.
